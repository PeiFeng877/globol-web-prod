  - question: "How many questions should I ask on a first date?"
    answer: "Aim for a balance. It should be a ping-pong match, not a survey. Ask one, listen to the answer, share your own answer, and let the conversation drift before asking the next."
  - question: "What questions should be avoided on a first date?"
    answer: "Avoid exes ('Why did you break up?'), finances ('How much do you make?'), and heavy politics—unless those are immediate deal-breakers for you."

First dates are a delicate dance. You want to get to know them, but you don't want to grill them. You want to be deep, but not *too* deep too soon.

The standard "interview script" (Where are you from? What do you do? How many siblings?) is safe, but it’s boring. It doesn't tell you **who they are**.

Here are 21 first date questions designed to reveal personality, values, and chemistry.

## The "Vibe Check" Questions
*Gauge their energy and outlook on life.*

### 1. "What’s the best thing that happened to you this week?"
**The Intel:** Are they an optimist or a complainer? Do they find joy in small things (a good bagel) or big things (a promotion)?

### 2. "What are you looking forward to right now?"
**The Intel:** Shows their ambition and future orientation. A person with nothing to look forward to might be stuck in a rut.

### 3. "How do you usually spend your weekends?"
**The Intel:** Lifestyle compatibility check. If they party until 4 a.m. and you hike at 7 a.m., you need to know now.

### 4. "What is your favorite way to relax?"
**The Intel:** Introvert vs. Extrovert check. Do they recharge alone or with people?

## The "Personality Reveal" Questions
*Figure out what makes them tick.*

### 5. "What was the last show you binge-watched?"
**The Intel:** Shared interests. Bonding over *The Office* or *Succession* is an easy win.

### 6. "If you could travel anywhere tomorrow, where would you go?"
**The Intel:** Adventure level. Are they dreaming of a resort in Mexico (relaxing) or backpacking in Peru (adventurous)?

### 7. "What is a skill you’ve always wanted to learn?"
**The Intel:** Growth mindset. Are they curious? Do they want to improve themselves?

### 8. "Who is the most interesting person you know?"
**The Intel:** Shows what they value in others. Do they admire their rich boss? Their kind grandmother? Their wild best friend?

### 9. "What is your biggest pet peeve?"
**The Intel:** Tolerance level. Is their pet peeve "rude people" (reasonable) or "loud chewing" (specific)? It’s also a fun way to bond over shared annoyances.

## The "Deeper Compatibility" Questions
*Subtle ways to check for values.*

### 10. "What is the most spontaneous thing you’ve ever done?"
**The Intel:** Risk tolerance.

### 11. "What is a cause you care about?"
**The Intel:** Values check. Animals? Environment? Social justice?

### 12. "What does a 'balanced life' look like to you?"
**The Intel:** Work-life balance. Are they a workaholic? Do they value family time?

### 13. "If you won the lottery, what would you do with your time?"
**The Intel:** Reveals their true passions if money wasn't an object.

### 14. "What is the best gift you’ve ever received?"
**The Intel:** Love language check. Was it a thoughtful handmade item or an expensive gadget?

## The "Fun & Flirty" Questions
*Keep the spark alive.*

### 15. "What is your go-to karaoke song?"
**The Intel:** Confidence level. Even if they don't sing, the answer tells you if they are fun.

### 16. "Have you ever had a supernatural experience?"
**The Intel:** It’s a weird question, but everyone loves telling ghost stories. It builds intimacy through fear/excitement.

### 17. "What is the worst pickup line you’ve ever heard?"
**The Intel:** Humor. It allows you to laugh at the dating game together.

### 18. "If we were to escape town right now, where should we drive?"
**The Intel:** Spontaneity and imagination. It plants the seed of a future adventure *together*.

## The Closers
*Wrap it up on a high note.*

### 19. "What is the best advice you've ever ignored?"
**The Intel:** Shows a rebellious streak or a lesson learned the hard way.

### 20. "What are you obsessed with right now?"
**The Intel:** Whether it's a new band, a video game, or a type of cheese—passion is contagious.

### 21. "Does this place have good dessert, or should we go somewhere else?"
**The Intel:** The ultimate test. If they say "Let's go somewhere else," the date is going well.

## Conclusion
Use these questions as a menu, not a checklist. The goal is to find one thread—travel, food, ghosts—and pull on it until you're both laughing and forgetting to check your phones.
